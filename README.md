# RenameFitsHeader

**Renames Headers in multiple files (in the folders or subfolders)**

At the moment the script renames only "Filter" value **in the .fit or .fits Header**. 

The user will be asked to choose the folder and the Old/New filter names/values.

At the end the script will generate .csv file with the list of amended files or any errors.

**Please note:**

.xsif files are not supported.

The script will Not change file names, - Only the HEADER value inside the file will be changed.

Useful for Astrophotography

Especially if during some sessions the different software was used for imaging
and the stacking software cannot recognise the correct filter.

**Work in Progress:**

1) Progress bar.
2) Additional Header to Select for amendment, for example: "Object name", "Session" and etc.
